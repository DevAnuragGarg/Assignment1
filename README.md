Create a timer that:
- Starts counting seconds when the component mounts.
- Displays the elapsed time.
- Stops counting when the component unmounts.

**Concepts Practiced**  
- `useEffect`  
- Cleanup in `useEffect`

### 5. Input Handling
**Problem Statement**  
Build a screen with:
- A `TextInput` for entering a name.
- A button to submit.
- When submitted, display: **"Hello, [name]!"**

**Concepts Practiced**  
- `useState` for input  
- Controlled components  

---

### 6. Todo List
**Problem Statement**  
Create a simple todo list:
- `TextInput` to enter a todo item.
- Button to add to the list.
- Display the list below.
- Each item should have a ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù button.

**Concepts Practiced**  
- `useState` with arrays  
- Mapping over data  
- Handling multiple actions  

---

### 7. Responsive Card Grid
**Problem Statement**  
Create a screen showing **6 cards** in a grid layout:
- Each card has a title and description.
- Cards wrap responsively based on screen width.

**Concepts Practiced**  
- Flexbox styling  
- Arrays of styles  

---

### 8. Memoized Component
**Problem Statement**  
Build a parent component that:
- Contains a counter and a text input.
- Passes props to a child component that displays the text.
- Uses `React.memo` to prevent the child from re-rendering when only the counter changes.

**Concepts Practiced**  
- `React.memo`  
- Props comparison  
- Performance optimization  

---

### 9. Custom Hook (`useFetch`)
**Problem Statement**  
Write a custom hook `useFetch` that:
- Takes a URL.
- Fetches data when mounted.
- Returns `loading`, `data`, and `error`.

**Usage Example**  
Fetch and display users from:  
`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`

**Concepts Practiced**  
- Custom hooks  
- `useEffect` for side effects  
- API calls  

---

### 10. Dark Mode Toggle
